# Project Overview
Every year millions of pounds of food are wasted to do incorrect inventory predicitions by grocery stores. In this project we will be using time-series forecasting to forecaast stores sales on data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, an Ecuadorian based grocery retailer. We are building a model that predicts the unit sales of items sold at different stores in the Favorita network. 

# Table of Contents
1. Feature Engineering - This folder contains the notebooks describing how we extract and engineer important features we discovered during exploratory data analysis.
2. Models - We worked on several different models for this task. The model notebooks can be found and ran here for each of the models.
3. code - This folder contains more basic exploratory analysis and early exploration of the data.
4. data - The raw and processed data are kept here.
5. documents - Important explanatory documents are in this folder.

# Installing and running the project
Create virtual environment and install requirements from requiremetns.txt found in documents.

# Credits
We used a variaty of resources to help us learn more about time series forecasting and the associated models, they can be found below.
